# VBA Challenge

You will find an Excel file containing the analyzed annual stock data and files containing the VBA code used to analyze the data.

## Description

Here is my version of the challenge. My code should demonstrate my understanding of VBA syntax using the four fundamental building blocks of code. I effectively use variables, functions, loops, and conditionals to summarize stock data for quick analysis.
